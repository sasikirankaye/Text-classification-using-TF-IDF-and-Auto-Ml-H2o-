# Project Name
Text classification of the complaints of bank using TF-IDF vectorizer and auto ml.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the type of the product(Credit card, vehicle loan etc) of the bank when the complaint text from the dataset was given.
we can route the complaint to the particular agent if the product was predicted correctly.

### Dataset
 The dataset was taken from the consumer financial corporation bureaue.
 You can find the dataset link here https://www.consumerfinance.gov/

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Auto ML(H2o)
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python(Numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seanborn,sklearn)
* H2o(Automl)
* MySql
* Pandas, jupyter
* HTML
* etc. 

## Project Description
The dataset was taken from Consumer Financial Protection bureaue. The main purpose of the project is to predict the type of the product sold by the bank when we read the customer complaint from the dataset. To understand the different variables exploratory data analysis was performed using tableaue, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
H2o auto ml was used to select the best model(Gradient boost classifier) , once the base model was selected we have done the hyper parameter tuning to improve the performance of the model.
## challenges
The challenges faced in the project are imbalancing of the classes which was solved by sklearn library.
